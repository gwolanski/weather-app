# weather-app
This weather app was a project assigned in the Odin Project curriculum. Overall, this was a really fun project that put our recent learning on APIs and asynchronous functions to use. The idea of APIs was very intimidating to me prior to this project, but I realized they aren't as complex as I initially thought and are such a great way to get dynamic data on the fly! 

I really enjoyed the creative aspect of this project. There are so many different ways that someone could display information for a weather app, so it was fun coming up with an effective and clean look for this website. I'm very happy with the result and can see how I've been improving throughout this program.

Some of the different HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools that I utilized for this project are as follows:
-Flexbox
-Grid
-Favicon
-Promises
-Async/await
-.then()/.catch()
-API/fetch()
-For loops
-Arrays
-Date logic
-Unit toggle
